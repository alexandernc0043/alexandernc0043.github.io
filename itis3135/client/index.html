        <h3>What is Kotlin?</h3>
        <p>Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language developed by <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a>.
            It was designed with a
            focus on conciseness, safety, and interoperability, particularly with Java. Here are some key aspects of
            Kotlin:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Conciseness and Readability: </strong>Kotlinâ€™s syntax is streamlined, reducing boilerplate code
                compared to Java
                and other languages.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Null Safety: </strong>The language includes features that help prevent common programming
                errors, such as null pointer exceptions, by distinguishing between nullable and non-nullable types.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Interoperability:</strong> Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, which means you can call
                Java code from
                Kotlin and vice versa. This makes it easier to gradually integrate Kotlin into existing Java projects.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Multi-Platform Support: </strong>Beyond running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Kotlin can
                compile to
                JavaScript for web development and to native binaries for platforms like iOS and desktop, through
                Kotlin/Native.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Support for Multiple Paradigms: </strong>It supports both object-oriented and functional
                programming styles,
                offering flexibility for different coding approaches.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Android Development: </strong>Google endorsed Kotlin as a first-class language for Android
                development in 2017,
                which has contributed to its widespread adoption in mobile app development.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, Kotlin offers modern language features and enhanced productivity, making it a popular choice for
            developing a wide range of applications from server-side software to mobile apps.</p>

        <code>
fun main() {
    println("Hello World!");
}
    </code>
Note: semicolons are optional in Kotlin.
