Final HTML Structure
Make sure your sections are wrapped inside <main>:

html
Copy
Edit
<main>
    <section id="home">...</section>
    <section id="about">...</section>
    <section id="when">...</section>
    <section id="where">...</section>
    <section id="how">...</section>
    <section id="why">...</section>
    <section id="ai">...</section>
</main>

<footer>
    <p>Project for <a href="../">ITIS 3135</a> | Designed by <a href="../alexanderprechteldesigns.com/index.html">Alexander Prechtel Designs</a></p>
</footer>
âœ… Expected Behavior
When content is short â†’ The footer stays at the bottom of the page (not floating in the middle).
When content is long â†’ The footer appears after all content and moves with scrolling (not fixed).
No overlapping â†’ The footer will never cover content.

ChatGPT said:
Your current CSS for <section> might be causing issues with the footer because:

Fixed height: 77vh â€“ This forces sections to be tall, which might prevent the footer from properly pushing down.
display: none; initially â€“ If no section is active at first, the page might not have enough content to push the footer down.
max-height: fit-content; â€“ This doesnâ€™t work well with height: 77vh, as height overrides max-height.
Recommended Fix
To ensure sections only take as much space as they need (instead of forcing height) and let the footer behave correctly, update your section CSS:

css
Copy
Edit
section {
    width: 75vw;
    min-height: 50vh; /* Allow content to expand naturally */
    height: auto; /* Let sections grow as needed */
    display: none;
    margin-bottom: 100px;
}
Why This Fix Works
âœ… Removes fixed height (height: 77vh), allowing sections to expand based on content.
âœ… Uses min-height: 50vh, ensuring sections still have some minimum height.
âœ… Keeps margin-bottom: 100px, maintaining spacing before the footer.
âœ… Ensures display: none; still works, but when sections are shown, they donâ€™t interfere with the footer.
Try This
After applying the fix, check:

If your footer now appears after content and moves naturally.
If your sections resize properly based on content.
